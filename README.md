## Summary
A deep dive in to the Cardio Vascular data set to identify existing trends and relationships between Gender, Age, Cholestrol, BP, BMI etc..

## Questions to be answered through the analysis.
* Which gender (male or female) is more likely to have CVD?
* Does age influence the potential risk factor of CVD?
* What type of lifestyle variables can increase the potential of contracting CVD?

## Data Cleanup & Exploration Process
### Exploration and cleanup process 
* 3 CSV files downloaded
* Converted CSV using Pandas Dataframe 
* No null values found in the Dataset
* Calculated and created BMI and Blood Pressure Columns 

## Challenges:
* Tried to unite 2 raw Datasets with different headers and observations
* Smaller data set had numerous null values. Once removed there was not enough data to make a significant impact on the larger dataset. 
* Inability to interpret available data from APIs

## Insights:
* Discovered majority of data contained dichotomous variables 
* Developed Logistic Regression to establish correlation between variables 
* Developed Contingency Tables 
* Developed a Predictive Model

## Solutions: 
* Resolved to use one Dataset due to mismatch in headers and duplicate data
* Opted not to include APIs in the project

## Tools & Libraries
  * Python
    * Pandas
    * Matplotlib 
    * Scipy 
    * Statsmodel
    * Sklearn 
    * Numpy
    * Seaborn
    
 ## Tables and Graphs
   * Bar
   * Pie
   * Hist
## Machine learning
  Logistic Regression
